{"id":"eldspire-dmu","title":"Add global search with command palette","description":"## Overview\nAdd a global search feature accessible via a command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K) that searches wiki pages by title.\n\n## Requirements\n- Command palette UI triggered by keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K)\n- Search pages by title (server-side query)\n- Display matching results as user types\n- Navigate to selected page on enter/click\n\n## Simple Implementation Approach\n1. **UI Component**: Use a modal/dialog with an input field. Consider cmdk (https://cmdk.paco.me/) or build a simple custom one with a dialog + input + results list.\n\n2. **Server Function**: Create a `createServerFn` that queries the D1 database:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT slug, title FROM pages \n   WHERE title LIKE '%' || ? || '%' \n   ORDER BY title LIMIT 10\n   ```\n\n3. **Keyboard Listener**: Add a global keydown listener in the root layout that opens the palette on Cmd/Ctrl+K.\n\n4. **Debounce**: Debounce the search input (300ms) to avoid excessive queries.\n\n## Future Enhancements (out of scope)\n- Full-text search on content\n- Fuzzy matching\n- Recent pages / frecency\n- Client-side caching","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-20T11:51:17.433939-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T11:56:37.715471-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T11:56:37.715471-06:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
