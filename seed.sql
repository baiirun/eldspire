# Eldspire

Eldspire is the towering capital city of the [[Verdant Kingdom]], known for its impossibly tall spires that seem to pierce the clouds themselves.

## History

The city was founded by [[Archmage Velorin]] over two thousand years ago, built upon the ruins of an ancient [[Precursor]] civilization. The original settlers discovered a massive deposit of [[Aetheric Crystals]] beneath the ground, which to this day power the city''s legendary floating gardens and eternal lanterns.

> [!note] Etymology
> The name "Eldspire" comes from the Old Tongue words *eld* (meaning "ancient" or "eternal") and *spire* (referring to the city''s distinctive architecture).

## Districts

The city is divided into several distinct districts:

- **The Pinnacle** - Home to the [[Royal Palace]] and the [[High Council]]
- **The Artisan Quarter** - Where master craftsmen forge ==legendary weapons== and artifacts
- **The Underspire** - The lower levels, shrouded in perpetual twilight
- **The Verdant Ring** - Gardens that encircle the city, maintained by [[Druid Circle of the Green]]

## Notable Locations

| Location | Description | Notable Figure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The Spellwright Tower | Academy of magic | [[Archon Lyris]] |
| The Gilded Scales | Merchant guild | [[Merchant Prince Theron]] |
| The Whispering Library | Ancient repository | [[Keeper Mira]] |

## Current Events

The city is currently facing a crisis as the [[Aetheric Crystals]] have begun to dim. The [[High Council]] has dispatched adventurers to seek the legendary [[Heart of the Spire]], an artifact said to be able to restore the crystals'' power.

# Archmage Velorin

![[velorin-portrait]]

**Archmage Velorin** (Year 1 - Year 847) was the legendary founder of [[Eldspire]] and the first wielder of the [[Heart of the Spire]].

## Early Life

Born in a small village at the edge of the [[Mistwood Forest]], Velorin showed an aptitude for [[Aetheric Magic]] from a young age. He was discovered by wandering scholars and taken to study with the [[Precursor]] ruins.

> [!tip] Historical Note
> Many historians believe Velorin was not entirely human, possibly having ==Precursor blood== in his lineage.

## Achievements

### The Founding of Eldspire

In Year 1 of the New Calendar, Velorin led a group of settlers to the site of modern-day [[Eldspire]]. Using his mastery of [[Aetheric Magic]], he:

1. Raised the first spire from raw stone
2. Activated the dormant [[Aetheric Crystals]]
3. Established the [[Spellwright Tower]]
4. Created the first ***floating gardens***

### The Great Working

His greatest achievement was the **Great Working**, a spell that bound the [[Heart of the Spire]] to the city itself, ensuring its prosperity for millennia.

```
The incantation of the Great Working:
"By crystal light and ancient stone,
I bind this heart to spire and throne.
Let power flow through every hall,
And Eldspire stand, never to fall."
```

## Legacy

Velorin''s teachings formed the basis of modern [[Aetheric Magic]]. His personal journals are kept in the [[Whispering Library]], though only [[Keeper Mira]] has full access.
